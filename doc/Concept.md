## Advantages and Disadvantages

Tool	Advantages	Disadvantages
Minikube	- Full Kubernetes compatibility
- Supports multi-node clusters
- Flexible driver options (VMs, Docker)	- Relatively heavy resource usage
- Slower startup
- Requires VM setup unless using Docker driver
Kind	- Lightweight and fast
- Easy Docker-based setup
- Great for CI/CD
- Portable clusters as Docker containers	- Limited multi-node cluster support
- Less suited for resource-heavy workloads
k3d	- Very fast and lightweight
- Uses k3s, a minimal Kubernetes distro
- Supports multi-node clusters
- Simple CLI management	- Some Kubernetes features may be trimmed in k3s
- Smaller community compared to Minikube/Kind
